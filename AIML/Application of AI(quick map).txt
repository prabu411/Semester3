Application of AI(quick map)

Vision: defect detection, medical imaging, autonomous driving.

NLP: assistants,summarization,chat,translation.

Planning & Robotics: Warehouse picking,drones,delivery,manipulation

**Recommendation & personalization:**Retail,media,ads.

Finance: fraud detection,risk scoring,algo trading.

**HealthCare:**triage,diagnosis,scheduling.

Games & Decesion-making: Search,reinforcement learning,statergy.

Classification of AI systems W.r.t.Enveroiment:


Environment differ along these axes(Russell-Norvig style) and the agent design follows:

Observable: Fully vs. Partially observable (e.g., fog of war).

Agents: Single-agent vs. Multi-agent (cooperative/competitive).

Deterministic vs. Stochastic (action outcomes uncertain).

Episodic vs. Sequential (current decision affects future).

Static vs. Dynamic (changes during deliberation).

Discrete vs. Continuous (states/time/actions).

Known vs. Unknown (model of dynamics known?).

Problem-Solving Agents & Search(Fomulation)

State space (start, goal, actions, transition).
Path cost (g), heuristic (h), evaluation (f).
Solution: a sequence of actions from start to goal

Core Graph Search Framework(reusable)

from heapq import heappush,heapop
from Collections import deque,defaultdict
import math,random

def reconstruct(parents,s,t):
 	path=[t]
 	while path[-1]!=s:
 		path.append(parents[path[-1]])
 	path.reverse()
 	return path

3A)Uniformed (Blind) Search Strategies

Breath-First Search:

BFS(start, goal):
    create a queue Q
    enqueue start state
    while Q is not empty:
        node = dequeue(Q)
        if node is goal → return solution
        for each child of node:
            enqueue(child)

Heuristic Search Strategies:


A*(Start,goal):
 	open={start}
 	g(start)=0
 	f(start)=h(start)
 	while open not empty:
 	node=node with lowest f
 	if node = goal -> return path
 	for each neighbor:
 		g(

UNIT_2
Logic Agent :

A logic agent is an AI system that uses Knowledge representation + inference to make decisions.

Example: A medical diagnosis agent knows rules like if p
